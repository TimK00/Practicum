# Practicum
MSDS 692 Practicum I

This repo is for housing all code and project files for the MSDS Practicum I course for Spring 2023

Excel file is expected output for EA_Fin project - note many dtsx files within EA_Fin are from Master Common ETL, which is the first file I attempted to analyze in this project

There are two DTSX files.  One is Master Common ETL for reasons explained above.  The second is the SSIS package I was using to try and parse XML named XML-test.

There are several XML and XSD files, these pair with XML-test in for the attempts at parsing.

Finally, there are SQL files that produced valuable tables but ultimately no useable results came from them.
